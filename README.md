Tally Docker Installation

Introduction
Tally is a well-known accounting software that allows users to manage business accounting and financials. In this project, we used Docker and Docker Compose to containerize Tally and its necessary dependencies, enabling a smooth and repeatable setup. The goal of this project is to set up a Tally Docker container, manage it, and verify its operation.

Learning Objectives
Docker & Docker Compose: Learn how to use Docker and Docker Compose to containerize and orchestrate services.
Tally Containerization: Set up a Tally container using Docker to run Tally software in an isolated environment.
Git: Clone a repository and use it for project setup.
Service Management: Use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers for Tally.

Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can follow the Docker Installation Guide for your platform.
Docker Compose: Make sure Docker Compose is installed. Docker Compose Installation Guide.
Git: Ensure Git is installed on your system. If it's not, follow the Git Installation Guide.

Steps: 

1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/g40st/tally_list_docker.git ~/Downloads/tally_list_docker/


2. Build the Docker Images
Next, we need to build the Docker images needed for Tally. This step will use the provided docker-compose.yml and docker-compose-prod.yml files.

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-prod.yml build

3. Start the Containers
Once the images are built, you can start the containers using the following command:

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-prod.yml up
This will start the containers in detached mode and allow the services defined in the docker-compose files to run. You should see logs in your terminal showing that the containers are up and running.

4. Verify the Containers are Running
To ensure that your Tally container is up and running, use the following command to check the status of your Docker containers:

docker ps

6. Stop the Containers
After you are done working with Tally, you can stop the running containers by using:

mpose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-prod.yml down
This command will stop all containers associated with the current Docker Compose configuration.

Conclusion
Through this project, I successfully containerized the Tally application using Docker and Docker Compose. This approach provides a scalable, portable solution for running Tally in any environment. The process also demonstrated how Docker can be used to manage multiple containers for services that rely on each other.
